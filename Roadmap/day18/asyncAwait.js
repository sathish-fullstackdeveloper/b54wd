/*
    Asynchronous:
        - Asynchronous programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress.
    
    Synchronous:
        - Synchronous programming is a means of programming in which a unit of work runs sequentially with another unit of work. i.e., the second unit of work cannot begin until the first unit of work has completed.
